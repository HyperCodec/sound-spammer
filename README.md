# sound spammer
Spams a bunch of loud sounds. Made in like 10 mins bc I was bored.


### How to Use
1. Either compile from source or download from the [releases](https://github.com/HyperCodec/sound-spammer/releases).
2. Fill the `/audio` folder with random audio files (`mp3`, `ogg`, and `wav` currently supported. it will check subdirectories as well)
3. Run the executable and enjoy.
